# APT Malware Dataset

[APTMalware](https://github.com/cyber-research/APTMalware) is an annotated meta-dataset for malware authorship attribution published by Coen Boot.
The ground truth is based on threat intelligence reports published by security companies like FireEye, F-Secure and Kaspersky.

The associated paper is called: [_Applying Supervised Learning on Malware Authorship Attribution_](https://cs.ru.nl/~aserban/theses/b_coen_boot.pdf)

This project provides a parser for the dataset CSV file and converts the data into a SQL model to efficiently perform queries.

An inconsistency was found for two sample hashes and their associated APT group name.

* **APT 28** was incorrectly assigned to **2 samples** that were actually attributed to **APT 29** (fixed in pull request [#2](https://github.com/cyber-research/APTMalware/pull/2))

This inconsistency was adjusted in the dataset (**overview.csv**) and the URLs to the reports have been updated as well.
